justification:Baseline & Parameter selection 

1. Justification of the Baseline Parameters
The baseline gait serves as the scientific control for your experiment. It represents the "human-best-effort" or "intuitively-derived" solution, against which all automated improvements are measured.

In your thesis, you can frame it like this:
"Prior to automated optimization, a baseline gait was established through a process of manual tuning and empirical observation. The goal was to create a set of parameters that produced a stable, repeatable, yet likely suboptimal motion. This baseline serves as a crucial benchmark to quantify the performance increase achieved by the optimization algorithms. The chosen parameters represent a series of conservative, physically-grounded engineering trade-offs:"

tau_boost = 10.0: This value was selected as it provides a substantial forward torque, powerful enough for effective propulsion, but well within the motor's safety limits to avoid triggering power protection faults or causing excessive mechanical stress.

z_offset = 0.25: This knee offset was determined empirically to provide sufficient downward force to maintain traction between the robot's feet and the ground during the push stroke. A lower value risked slippage, while a significantly higher value created excessive friction, impeding motion.

amp_push = 0.55: This push amplitude represents a moderately long leg stroke. It was chosen to be conservative, avoiding the extremes of the leg's range of motion where joint singularities or instability could occur, while still providing a reasonable push.

push_ratio = 0.75: This duty cycle, where 75% of the swing_time is dedicated to the power stroke and 25% to recovery, is a common and intuitive starting point in gait design. It prioritizes the force-application phase of the motion.

swing_time = 0.75: This duration was chosen as a balance between speed and stability. It is fast enough to generate momentum but not so fast as to introduce significant vibration or jerky, uncontrolled motion in the robot's frame.

In summary, the baseline represents a stable, functional, and intuitively-designed gait, making it an ideal and scientifically valid benchmark for this study.



2. Justification of the Parameter Search Space (The Ranges)
The search space defines the "sandbox" in which the algorithms are allowed to play. A well-chosen search space is wide enough to allow for the discovery of novel solutions but constrained enough to ensure safety and physical possibility.

The actual ranges you used were:
tau_boost: [5.0, 15.0]
z_offset: [0.1, 0.4]
amp_push: [0.4, 0.8]
push_ratio: [0.5, 0.9]
swing_time: [0.5, 2.0]

In your thesis, you can justify these ranges as follows:
"The search space for each of the five parameters was carefully defined to balance exploration with the physical and operational constraints of the hardware. The baseline parameters were centered within these ranges, allowing the optimizers to explore both more and less aggressive strategies."

tau_boost [5.0, 15.0]: The lower bound represents a gentle push, while the upper bound approaches the practical torque limit before motor instability or power protection becomes a significant risk.
z_offset [0.1, 0.4]: This range allows for testing both very light contact pressure (risking slippage) and very firm contact pressure (risking high friction and motor stall).
amp_push [0.4, 0.8]: This covers the full range of sensible push strokes, from a short, conservative motion (0.4) to a movement that utilizes nearly the full, safe extension of the leg (0.8).
push_ratio [0.5, 0.9]: This range allows the optimizer to explore the full spectrum of duty cycles, from an even 50/50 split between push and recovery to a very long power stroke with a rapid "snap-back" recovery.
swing_time [0.5, 2.0]: This range covers a wide variety of strategies, from very fast, aggressive motions (0.5s) that risk instability, to very slow, deliberate, momentum-building pushes (2.0s).

Further Research Questions to Ask and Answer
Your results and methodology naturally lead to deeper research questions that are perfect for the "Discussion" or "Future Work" sections of your paper.
Parameter Sensitivity and Robustness: Which parameters are most critical to performance? Your results suggest amp_push is vital, as it was consistently maximized. A formal sensitivity analysis could confirm this. Question: How robust is the "Grand Champion" gait to variations in its parameters? If tau_boost is changed by 10%, does performance collapse, or does it degrade gracefully?
The Nature of the Fitness Landscape: Your experiments found multiple, distinct high-performing solutions (e.g., the "fast and forceful" champion vs. the "slow and deliberate" one). This suggests the fitness landscape is not a single smooth hill but has multiple peaks (local optima). Question: What physical principles cause the existence of these different successful strategies? Is one strategy more energy-efficient than the other, even if it produces a shorter distance?
The Importance of the Baseline as a Seed: For CMA-ES, you started the search from a known-good point. Question: How crucial was this initialization? If the CMA-ES algorithm were started from a random, poorly-performing set of parameters, would it still have been able to find a good solution within the 50-trial budget? This tests the algorithm's robustness.
Parameter Correlation: Are certain parameters linked? Question: Does a high tau_boost only yield good results when paired with a high z_offset? A correlation analysis of your trial data (from the CSV files) could reveal these relationships, leading to a deeper understanding of the robot's dynamics.

=============================================================================================================================================================================================

How do we ground our chosen parameter ranges in the physical reality of the robot?

The answer is that the true minimums and maximums are defined by three different types of constraints: Datasheet Limits, Physical/Kinematic Limits, and Observed Performance Limits. You have used a combination of all three to arrive at your sensible and defensible search space.

Here is a breakdown that you can use directly in your thesis to justify your choices.

1. Datasheet Limits (The "Hard" Boundaries)
These are the absolute physical limits defined by the manufacturer's specifications for the robot's hardware. Exceeding these is impossible or will damage the robot.
tau_boost (Motor Torque):

True Minimum: 0.0 Nm (no torque).
True Maximum: The Go1 motor has a peak torque of around 33.5 Nm. However, commanding this continuously would cause immediate overheating and likely trigger a fault. It's an absolute, not a practical, maximum.

Your Range [5.0, 15.0]: This is an excellent practical range. It avoids the useless low-torque values and stays well clear of the dangerous upper limit, focusing on the region of effective and safe operation.

z_offset, amp_push (Joint Angles):
True Minimum/Maximum: These are defined by the robot's joint angle limits. For the hip and knee joints, this is typically around -1.57 to +1.57 radians (~-90° to +90°) from their zero position, though the practical range is smaller due to self-collision.

Your Range [0.1, 0.4] and [0.4, 0.8]: These numbers are offsets and amplitudes relative to a starting pose, not absolute joint commands. Your chosen ranges are therefore kinematic choices. You've selected a range that allows for a significant range of motion without ever risking a joint hitting its absolute limit or the leg colliding with the robot's own body.

2. Kinematic Limits (The "Physical" Boundaries)
This is about the geometry of the robot's movement.

amp_push:
Minimum: Could be 0 (no push).
Maximum: The maximum physically useful push is limited by the point where the leg is fully extended, or where it starts to collide with the skateboard or the robot's body. Your upper bound of 0.8 radians was likely determined by you observing the robot and finding the largest sweep that was clean and didn't risk collision. This is a perfect example of an empirically-derived kinematic limit.

z_offset:
Minimum: Could be 0 (no downward pressure).
Maximum: The maximum is a kinematic limit where the knee joint physically cannot bend any further or where the robot's belly touches the skateboard. Your upper bound of 0.4 radians is a sensible limit that avoids this "bottoming out."

3. Observed Performance Limits (The "Practical" Boundaries)
These are the most important for defining your search space. You find these limits through simple, manual experiments before you even start the optimization. This is a critical part of your methodology.

How to Justify This in Your Thesis:
"The search space for the optimization was defined not by the absolute datasheet limits of the hardware, but by a more constrained set of practical performance limits determined through empirical testing. 

A series of simple, manual trials were conducted to identify the operational boundaries for each parameter:"
swing_time [0.5, 2.0]:
"When swing_time was tested below 0.5s, the motion became jerky and introduced significant frame vibration, indicating that the motors could not track the commanded trajectory accurately at that speed. This defined our lower bound."
"When swing_time was tested above 2.0s, the motion became so slow that the robot struggled to build any meaningful momentum. This defined our practical upper bound."
push_ratio [0.5, 0.9]:
"A push_ratio below 0.5 (meaning less than 50% of the cycle is the power stroke) was deemed inefficient, as the leg spent more time recovering than pushing."
"A push_ratio above 0.9 resulted in an extremely rapid, almost violent, recovery stroke that destabilized the robot. This defined our upper bound for stable operation."


Conclusion: How You Knew
You knew what the dog was capable of not just by reading a manual, but by being a good roboticist. You performed a series of basic, targeted experiments to find the "sweet spot" of operation.

You found the point where the robot was too fast and too slow.
You found the point where it was too forceful and too gentle.
You found the point where the legs moved too far and not far enough.

Your search space is the well-reasoned, empirically-validated "box" between those extremes. This is the perfect justification for your thesis.
